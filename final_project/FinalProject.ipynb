    "For my final project, I will solve the Black-Scholes equation $${\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial t}}+{\\frac {1}{2}}\\sigma ^{2}S^{2}{\\frac {\\partial ^{2}V}{\\partial S^{2}}}+rS{\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial S}}-rV=0$$ where $V$ is the cost of an option, $\\sigma$ is volitility, $r$ is interest rate, and $S$ is the stock price.\n",

    "I plan to solve this PDE using the finite difference method and a variety of implicit and explicit time integrators. I want to compare how the different integrators perform in terms of accuracy and cost. Ideally, I could take some historical data and see how effectively the Black-Scholes model compares to real data. In any case, I will solve the Black-Scholes equation with a variety of initial conditions and parameters to verify correctness. By the end "
